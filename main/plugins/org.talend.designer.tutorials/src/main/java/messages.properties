TutorialsDialog.panel1.message=Get started building your first job. After taking the tour you should be familiar with all the parts of the studio, now let\u2019s bring it all together.\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Create the new <b>job</b> from the menu icon shown.\r\nStep 2 \u2013 Expand the <b>Metadata</b> section on the left and expand <b>File Delimited</b> to find and drag in the metadata for the flat file <b>StreamngResults.csv</b> to the design window.
TutorialsDialog.panel2.message=Next you will build the full job flow by adding the tMap component, used to map input source columns to output target columns, and then a final component the tFileOutputDelimited component used to write to a flat file.\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Either type in the design window tMap and select tMap, or drag it over from the palette under Processing on the right to the design window.\r\nStep 2 \u2013 Connect the tFileInputDelimited to the tMap by clicking on the output row connector as shown in the video.\r\nStep 3 \u2013 Right click on the tMap and select Row and select *New Output* and drag and release and start typing tFileOutputDelimited once visible select it and it will be connected to the tMap.
TutorialsDialog.panel3.message=In this step, you will be mapping the input fields to the output field and in this example creating the output schema at the same time.\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Double Click on the tMap Component to open the mapping interface.\r\nStep 2 \u2013 Highlight the fields you want in the output file and drag them to the output side (Note: when there a dark blue line visible release the mouse to drop them into the target. This will create the target columns in the tFileOutputDelimited schema.)\r\nStep 3 \u2013 Click OK and Yes to save changes and to propagate the changes to the output file schema.
TutorialsDialog.panel4.message=The final step is to run the job within the studio runtime environment and view results.\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Click on the Run Tab below the Design window\r\nStep 2  - Click Run \r\nNote \u2013 this builds the java needed to execute the flow built in the job.  Once the java has been built the job executes.  You will see the throughput metrics on the rows between each component.  You can either open the file from the tFileOutputDelimeted or right click on the components and choose view data to see the data written to the target file.
